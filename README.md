# Diagnostic Robotics: AI-Powered Healthcare Transformation
Academic Context
This project was developed as part of an AI Practicum course, focusing on the end-to-end integration of Artificial Intelligence within complex healthcare systems.

Project Overview
Analysis of Diagnostic Robotics, an Israeli HealthTech leader using AI to shift healthcare from reactive to preventive. 
The core focus is on AI-Powered Population Health Management—identifying high-risk patients and closing care gaps through automated yet supervised workflows.

The "Human-in-the-Loop" Edge
A central theme of this project is the insistence on Human-in-the-Loop (HITL). Unlike fully automated systems, our proposed workflow involves medical validation at two critical stages:
1. Pre-Action Validation: A doctor reviews and approves the AI-generated high-risk list before any patient contact.
2. Post-Action Review: Doctors review summaries from Maxine (the virtual agent) to ensure clinical accuracy and ethical oversight.

Technology Stack
* Prediction Models: Analyzing historical records, lab results, and past visits to predict deterioration.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Extracting insights from free-text clinical notes.
* Maxine (Virtual Agent): An automated agent that handles patient outreach via SMS and calls, reducing administrative burnout.
* Seamless Integration: Using APIs to push recommendations directly into existing EMR (Electronic Medical Record) systems.

Business & Clinical Impact
- Hospitalization Reduction: ~25% decrease in avoidable ER visits and hospitalizations.
- Operational Efficiency: Saving over 30 minutes daily per medical team member.
- Financial ROI: 30% reduction in overall treatment costs, totaling approximately ₪500 million in annual savings.

Ethical AI & Risk Management
The project deep-dives into 6 critical risks of AI in healthcare, including AI Bias, Data Privacy (HIPAA/GDPR), and the potential loss of Clinical Judgment.
Our solution emphasizes that AI should support, not replace, human decision-making by providing multiple options and explaining its rationale.
